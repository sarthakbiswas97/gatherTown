// join space
// socket connection -> validation for user and space existence -> joins space -> inform the user and all the users
// for each new connection store -> which user joined (userId) -> which space (spaceId)
// for each space keep the dimensions handy (spaceDimensions)
// keep the users initial position handy (userPosition)

// handle moves
// get the space in which user is from 
// check dimensions with respect to move cordinates
// if inside bound then move otherwise reject move

//before leaving store the current positins in db -> 
// will remove the user from the space array 
// and clear all the in memory spaces
// and close the connection for that user
